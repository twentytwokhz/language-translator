<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This plugin allows you to translate selected text into the desired language.
It's based on a free instance of Azure Translator. Please do not abuse it :)

_Word of advice_

Keep in mind this is an **initial** version and that the plugin interface is _subject to change_!
PS: If you have recommendations please see the [Contributing](##Contributing) section

## Installing

Find this plugin in the listing of community plugins in Obsidian and add it to your application.

Or, if you'd like to install it manually, clone this repository to the `.obsidian/plugins/` directory in your vault, navigate to your newly cloned folder, run `npm i` or `yarn` to install dependencies, and run `npm run build` or `yarn build` to compile the plugin.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

fr:I want to break free
```
